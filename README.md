# Dual-Class-classification

This project is a simple classification algorithm using Machine Learning.

I've used [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) as the programiing evironment. But this algorithm can be used in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) as well.

The dataset can be [downloaded by clicking here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-AtM0ESqXej_de8QVGqjsAgNEMlUvp7K?usp=sharing) or can be shared with your drive directly and used.
